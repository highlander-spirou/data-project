# Annualized Rate of Return

**Total Increase**, also called *period performance*, is calculated as 

$$ x = { (end -start) \over start} $$
or
$$ x = {(end/start)-1} $$

**Annualized Return (AP)**  is calculated as

$$ AP = {({(end / start) ^ {(1 / Number Of Year)}} - 1)*100} $$

**Total Profit**:  

$$ Total Profit = end-start $$


**Predicted_price based on AP**: if you invests $1000 in a fund that has 10.67% annualized return for four years, after four year you will have:

$$ start * (1 + AP) ^ {Number Of Year} $$
